Variable in TypeScript
    The type syntax for declaring a variable in TypeScript is to include a colon (:) after the variable name, followed by its type.

var Declarations
    - var 
        Declaring a variable in JavaScript has always traditionally been done with the var keyword.

let Declarations
    - let 
        By now youâ€™ve figured out that var has some problems, which is precisely why let statements were introduced. 
        Apart from the keyword used, let statements are written the same way var statements are.

const Declarations
    - const
        const declarations are another way of declaring variables.

Remark 
    - can'n Declarations Variable Duplicate in project
